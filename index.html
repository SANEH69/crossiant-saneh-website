        A croissant is a buttery, flaky French pastry that's crescent-shaped and often eaten for breakfast. The word "croissant" comes from the French word for "crescent" or "crescent of the moon". 
        <strong>Ingredients and preparation</strong> 
        Croissants are made from laminated yeast dough, similar to puff pastry.
        The dough is rolled out, folded, and refrigerated multiple times. 
        The dough is then rolled out again and cut into triangles. 
        Each triangle is gently rolled into a croissant shape. 
        The croissants can be brushed with egg wash to help them caramelize. 
        <strong> Fillings and flavors </strong> 
        Croissants can be plain or filled with sweet or savory ingredients.
        Sweet fillings include almonds, marzipan, or chocolate.
        Savory fillings include cheese, spinach, or ham.
        <strong>Serving</strong> 
        Croissants are often served with coffee or tea.
        <strong>History</strong> 
        The croissant is inspired by the Austrian pastry called the kipferl.
        In the 1830s, an Austrian opened a bakery in Paris that became very popular, inspiring the French croissant.
